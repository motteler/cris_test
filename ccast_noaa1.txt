calibration options

--------------------------------

  SW FOV 5 rel: slightly improved, now very close to noaa 4
  MW FOV 5 rel: side FOVs worse, now slightly worse than noaa 4
  LW FOV 5 rel: corner FOVs slightly worse, residual moved around,
                closer to but still worse than noaa 4

  SW sweep dif: corner FOVs slightly improved, all FOVs now very
                close to noaa 4

                side FOVs worse, slightly worse than noaa 4, FOV 5
                residual spread out, slightly worse than noaa 4

  LW sweep dif: FOV 5 improved, all FOVs now very close to noaa 4

2015-04-12 notes
-----------------

  applied phase correction at the tail end of processing, this
  didn't seem to have any effect

  looked at complex residuals, they are largest at the low end of
  the LW band, where the sweep difference is greatest

2015-04-10 notes
-----------------

  LW filter shifts, no improvement over vr = 15

  LW sinc vs psinc--results were very close, almost no difference

  note that the sinc vs psinc difference for FOV 5 is much less than
  for the other FOVs

  main problems: (1) FOV 5 sweep difference is much greater, and
  (2) FOV 5 relative residuals are greater
