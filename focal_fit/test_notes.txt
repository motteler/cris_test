CrIS focal plane tests.

These are done by modifying the focal plane in various ways, and
also for some tests by varying the met laser wavelength used for
the calibration calcs.  Then obs calculated with the mods can be 
compared with unmodified obs or with calculated reference truth.

Test 6: wlaser +5 ppm shift, wlaser * (1 + 5e-6), stock v33a focal
plane

Test 5: no wlaser shift, focal plane with v33a off-axis angles for
side FOBs reduced 6.7 pct and corner FOVs reduced 3 pct.

Test 4: wlaser -4 ppm, wlaser * (1 - 4e-6), focal plane from
fp_test4 and mkSAtest4

Test 3: wlaser -5 ppm, wlaser * (1 + 5e-6), 2 foax shifts per band
starting from v33a.  See mkSAtest3 for details.

Test 2: no wlaser shift, 2 foax shifts per band starting from v33a.
See mkSAtest2 for details.

Test 1: no wlaser shift, default (ATBD) focal plane
