test notes
-----------

algorithm c6, test directory sdr60_hr

this is the ccast "ratio first" reference calibration equation, 
with passband set to the user grid, a 15 cm-1 rolloff in the LW, 
20 cm-1 in the MW, and 22 cm-1 in the SW, and added guard points.

algorithm e0, test directory e0_Pn_ag

This used downward shifts of 0.32 cm-1 for the corner, 0.16 cm-1 
for the side and 0.02 cm-1 for the center FOV, for the first filter
application, before the SA correction, for the LW.  This had no
noticable effect in comparison with c6.

algorithm e1, test directory e1_Pn_ag

  case 'LW', pL =  650; pH = 1100; vr = 20;
  case 'MW', pL = 1200; pH = 1760; vr = 30;
  case 'SW', pL = 2145; pH = 2560; vr = 30;

This was a test of extending the passband 10 cm-1 in the MW and SW,
0 on the LHS of the LW, and 5 on RHS of the LW.

In comparison with c6, FOV 5 relative response was worse in the LW,
better for the MW side FOVs, and similar to slightly better for the
SW side FOVs.  In comparison with c6, sweep direction differences
were better for MW side FOVs, slightly better for MW FOV 5, slightly
better for SW corner FOVs, and slightly worse for SW side FOVs.

algorithm e2, test directory e2_Pn_ag

  case 'LW', pL =  645; pH = 1100; vr = 20;
  case 'MW', pL = 1200; pH = 1760; vr = 30;
  case 'SW', pL = 2150; pH = 2555; vr = 30;

In comparison with e1, this test extends the LHS of the LW passband
5 cm-1 and pulls in the SW passband by 5 cm-1.  (MW is unchanged.)

In comparison with c6 and e1 FOV 5 relative response was much worse
in the LW and generally similar in the SW, with e1 slightly better
than c6 or e2 for side FOVs.  In comparison with e1 sweep direction
difference were very similar in the SW--slightly better than c6 for
the corner FOVs and slightly worse for the side FOVs

algorithm e3, test directory e3_Pn_ag

  case 'LW', pL =  655; pH = 1100; vr = 20;

This test moves the LHS of the LW passband up 5 cm-1 into the user
grid.  In comparison with c6, FOV 5 relative resonse is improved,
though we still see the partition into side, corner and center FOV
groups.  Sweep direction differences are similar.

This is the only test to show improvement in relative FOV response,
but at the cost of giving up some of the user grid.

algorithm e4, test directory e3_Pn_ag

  case 'LW', pL =  648; pH = 1100; rL = 12; rH = 20;

This is a variation of c6 that opens up the LHS passband 2 cm-1
followed with a 12 cm-1 rolloff.  No significant difference from c6
for most of the band.  The RHS in this (and some of the other) tests
is better right at the edge, probably due to bumping out the RHS
passband by 5 cm-1.

algorithm e5, test directory e5_Pn_ag

  case 'LW', pL =  650; pH = 1100; rL = 15; rH = 20;
  case 'MW', pL = 1200; pH = 1760; rL = 30; rH = 30;
  case 'SW', pL = 2145; pH = 2560; rL = 30; rH = 30;

test e1 was best for the MW and SW bands.  No usable test improved
the LW band, so we keep the 15 cm-1 rolloff from c6 on the LHS but
add the 5 cm-1 passband extension and 20 cm-1 rolloff from some of
the other tests.
