correlation stats for instrument noise and obs minus calc
residuals

  cal_test3   - basic correlation stats for clear matchups
  cal_test5   - more detailed stats for clear matchups

cal_test3 does basic unapodized correlation plots for each band.
cal_test5 does more detailed apodized stats for the LW band.

  nedn_stats1 - tabulate ICT radiance from a modified ccast run
  nedn_stats2 - plot ICT noise correlation and singular values

nedn_stats1 tabulates ICT obs from a modified calmain, and saves
the results in nedn_cat.mat.  nedn_stats2 loads this and does noise
correlation and SVD plots.  Note that data from the ccast run used 
by nedn_stats1 has been deleted.

The following are the start of a more comprehensive ICT and SP
look dump; the dump works but I never did anything with the data.

  calmain_nedn - mod to dump ICT and SP looks
  ccast_nedn   - top level driver for NEdN tabulation
  rdr2sdr_nedn - main processing loop for NEdN tabulation
